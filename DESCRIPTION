Description: CLIMB dissects the cellular composition of bulk samples by finding the best combination of single cells using a scRNA-seq dataset as a reference to reconstruct bulk expression from a bulk RNA sequencing target sample. The learned single-cell to bulk sample mapping can then be grouped to obtain cell-subtype proportion estimates and cell-type gene expression for each bulks.
