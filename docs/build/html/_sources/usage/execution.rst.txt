**Run CLIFF** 

The easiest is to use a jupyter notebook at the root of CLIFF folder and load all functions as shown in `cliff_example_invitro.ipynb`:

``from cliff.Cliff import Cliff, Cliff_CV
from cliff.DataContainer import DataContainer
from cliff.utils import sigmoid, rmse``

don't forget to import all required libraries. 

For help about input / output of cliff functions, visit the class/function page.
